IOU log: June 23, deep diving within meshes and nodes.

With digital culture, we are discovering a new type of virtual reality. How does the human mind adjust to such an epic switch?

Ä°ntersection of Universes is a metaphor for the reconquista of technical processes by intuition and mindfulness.

Archaeology consists in exploring orthogonal space in order to generate fragmented models of temporal reality. As a metaphor, achaeology has been applied to knowledge in order to generate yet other fragmented models.

Can archaeology be applied to explorations of neither time, space, culture, but also complex functional processes such as the average inner representation of the outside world? We sure think so.
