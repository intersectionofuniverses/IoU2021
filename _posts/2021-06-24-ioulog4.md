IOU log: June 24, throwback Thursday: visiting and scanning the Jura's prehistoric sites last week.

When it comes to human Prehistory, the Jura mountains are less famous than Dordogne, Ardèche or even the Paris bassin.

However, during interglacial periods, humans from the Mousterian culture onward visited the region. In Chalain for instance, researchers have found traces of lakeside housings.

Could they foresee the Tchernobyl radioactive clouds from the 1970s? Did their animal gods tell them about CERN's LHC? Many questions surrounding this exotic-continental lagoon of unspeakable beauty.
